# CyberAI

This repository contains the foundation for an enterprise application that combines cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. The goal is to build tools that detect threats, automate responses, and provide a scalable platform for security operations.

## Structure

- `docs/PLAN.md` – Project plan and roadmap.
- `src/cyberai/` – Python package for security and AI modules.
- `tests/` – Unit tests for the codebase.
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

Use the plan in `docs/PLAN.md` to guide further development.
