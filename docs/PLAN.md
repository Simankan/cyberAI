# Cybersecurity AI Application Plan

## Overview

This project aims to build an enterprise application that leverages artificial intelligence to improve cybersecurity. The plan outlines the initial architecture, modules, and development phases required to create a robust solution.

## Goals

1. **Threat Detection**: Use AI models to detect anomalies and potential security incidents in network traffic and system logs.
2. **Incident Response Automation**: Provide automated responses or recommendations when threats are identified.
3. **Continuous Learning**: Collect data from incidents to continuously refine detection models.
4. **Scalability**: Design the system to handle large volumes of data typically found in enterprise environments.

## Architecture

- **Data Ingestion**: Components responsible for gathering logs, network traffic, and security events from various sources.
- **Data Storage**: A scalable datastore for raw and processed security events.
- **AI Engine**: Machine learning models that analyze security data for anomalies and threats.
- **Response Module**: Interfaces for triggering alerts or automated mitigations.
- **Dashboard**: Web-based interface for monitoring and managing security events.

## Initial Modules

1. `security.py` – Core functionality related to security data handling.
2. `ai.py` – Placeholder for AI/ML functionality, such as model training and inference.
3. Tests under `tests/` – Basic unit tests to verify that modules load correctly.

## Development Phases

1. **Foundation**: Set up repository structure with modules and tests.
2. **Prototype**: Implement basic data ingestion and a simple anomaly detection algorithm.
3. **Expansion**: Integrate with real security data sources, refine AI models, and add response automation.
4. **Production**: Harden security, add monitoring, and deploy in a containerized environment.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Run `pytest` to execute tests.
3. Extend the modules as described in the development phases.
